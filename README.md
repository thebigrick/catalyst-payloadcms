### Extending PayloadCMS Configuration

The plugin provides a base PayloadCMS configuration that can be extended through the Pluginizr system.

To add collections or modify the PayloadCMS configuration, create a local plugin using [Pluginizr](https://github.com/thebigrick/catalyst-pluginizr) and register your modifications as shown below:

```typescript
// plugins/my-plugin/src/register-plugins.ts

import { registerValuePlugin } from "@thebigrick/catalyst-pluginizr";
import { Config } from "payload";
import { Media } from "./collections/Media";

registerValuePlugin<Config>({
    name: "PayloadCMSConfig",
    resourceId: "@thebigrick/catalyst-payloadcms/payload.raw.config",
    wrap: (config) => ({
        ...config,
        collections: [
            ...config.collections,
            Media
        ]
    })
});
```

Example collection configuration:

```typescript
// plugins/my-plugin/src/collections/Media.ts

import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Media: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'media',
  access: {
    read: () => true,
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'alt',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  upload: true,
}
```
